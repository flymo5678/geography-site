      <p>One of the worst and dangerous consequences of deforestation is the extinction of plant and animal species due to losing their habitat. 70% of land species live in forests, deforestation could cause the loss of so many species known and yet to be discovered.</p>

      <p>As well as the dangers to land species, deforestation causes an increase in the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. This is due to the fact that trees take in carbon dioxide and give out oxygen. The increased amount of carbon dioxide traps more heat in the Earth's atmosphere leading to more global warming.</p>

      <p>Trees in forests also help to regulate the water cycle. When forests are deforested, there is less water to be returned to the ground which means that crops can't be grown there.</p>
