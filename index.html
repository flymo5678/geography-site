      <p>Since the late 1940s, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations has been conducting a global assesment of forrest resoureces every 5 to 10 years. According to the graph, Brazil has the most deforested area then every other country during 1990 and 2005. The country has lost around 42 million hectares of forest.</p>

      <p>Poverty is often blamed to be the underlying cause of mass tropical deforestation, due to it leading people to work in industries that raze trees, such as farming and manufacturing industries, but studies indicate that that explanation is an enormous oversimplification. Although poverty is a factor in deforestation, it is not the sole reason.</p>

      <p>Some of the main causes of deforestation are agriculture, forest fires, logging, fuelwood harvesting, mining and climate change. Climate change is both a cause and an effect of deforestation. By drying out tropical rainforests the chances of a forest fires are increased</p>
